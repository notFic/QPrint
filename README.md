Hello world test commit - Espelita
Another Hello Test Commit - Escalante

this branch's purpose is to send the newly updated UIs for the three available templates currently

commit #1: adding the UI stuff
commit #2 10/2/2025: added staff dashboard, but it is a very crude implementation. as of now it an if else statements that checks if the user is an admin or not defaults to the else statement, and that else statement leads to the STAFF dashboard. we need to implement user roles soon, but for now i wanted to practice redirecting pages when you successfully do something.
